# Single Node Installation
## Docker Compose Installation

### Artifactory
1. Extract the contents of the compressed archive (.tar.gz file) and then go to the extracted folder.
    ```
    # wget https://releases.jfrog.io/artifactory/artifactory-pro/org/artifactory/pro/docker/jfrog-artifactory-pro/7.33.9/jfrog-artifactory-pro-7.33.9-compose.tar.gz
    # tar -xvf jfrog-artifactory-pro-<version>-compose.tar.gz
    # cd jfrog-artifactory-pro-<version>
    ```
2. Run the script to setup folders with required ownership. This is an interactive script.
    ```
    # ./config.sh
    ```
3. Customize the product configuration (optional) including database, Java Opts, and filestore.
    ```
    # vim $JFROG_HOME/artifactory/var/etc/system.yaml
    shared:
    ....
      node:
        id: "art1"
        ip: "192.168.xx.xx‚Äù
    ....
    ```
4. Manage Artifactory using native Docker Compose commands, docker-compose -p rt <action> command.<br>
Run this command from the extracted folder.
    ```
    # docker-compose -p rt-postgres -f docker-compose-postgres.yaml up -d
    # docker-compose -p rt up -d
    # docker-compose -p rt ps
    # docker-compose -p rt down
    ```
6. Check Artifactory Log.
    ```
    # docker-compose -p rt logs
